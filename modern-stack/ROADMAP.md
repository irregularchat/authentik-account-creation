### 🚧 In Progress
- **v0.2.2**: Signal CLI Bot Integration (Critical Production Fixes)

#### v0.2.2 - Signal CLI Bot Production Ready
**🎯 GOAL**: Implement production-grade Signal CLI bot with comprehensive command system

**CRITICAL DISCOVERIES FROM PRODUCTION ANALYSIS**:

1. **🚨 Signal CLI REST API Group Messaging Bug** (BLOCKER)
   - **Issue**: bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api has critical group messaging bug
   - **Impact**: All group send attempts via `/v1/send` and `/v2/send` return 400 errors
   - **Production Solution**: Hybrid approach - WebSocket for receiving, direct CLI for sending
   - **Status**: Currently investigating workarounds

2. **📱 Signal CLI WebSocket Receiving Works Perfectly**
   - **Discovery**: WebSocket connection for receiving messages is stable
   - **Architecture**: Use WebSocket for real-time message reception
   - **Implementation**: Enhanced message processing with detailed logging

3. **🔧 Production Bot Architecture Insights**
   - **Plugin System**: Modular command system with SQLite storage
   - **Command Types**: 50+ commands across 7 plugin categories (AI, knowledge, onboarding, utilities)
   - **Database**: SQLite for sessions, plugin data, and persistent storage
   - **WebSocket**: Real-time message reception with automatic reconnection

4. **🆔 Group ID Format Complexity** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue**: Signal sends same group in 3 different ID formats
   - **Formats**: Raw Base64, URL-safe Base64, with/without "group." prefix
   - **Solution**: Group ID mapping module for consistent matching
   - **Impact**: Commands fail randomly without proper ID normalization

**IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES**:
- [ ] Fix group messaging using direct CLI approach
- [ ] Implement plugin-based command system  
- [ ] Add Group ID normalization module
- [ ] Create SQLite-based session storage
- [ ] Build comprehensive command library (50+ commands)
- [ ] Add WebSocket reconnection and health monitoring

**PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE LEARNINGS**:
```javascript
// Hybrid messaging approach
sendGroupMessage() {
  // Stop REST API container
  // Execute signal-cli send command directly  
  // Restart REST API container
  // Reconnect WebSocket
}
```
